# Agent readiness check

Checks how well an AI agent can discover, understand and use a developer product, using only publicly observable, mechanical signals: files that exist, pages that return certain content, links that are present. It does not judge whether the docs are good writing, whether the product is good, or whether a strategic choice was correct. Those judgement calls go into a separate "Needs human review" list and are never scored.

This skill produces the same score for the same site on the same rubric version, run by a different agent. Determinism comes from three things: a fixed sample set of pages (built the same way every time), exact pass conditions per check (see `references/rubric.md`), and a fixed rule for handling anything that cannot be reached.

## Before you start

- This is a mechanical check, not a review. If a check's pass condition is met, it passes, even if a human would want to look closer. Save that instinct for "Needs human review."
- If a `DEVREL.md` exists for the product (repository root, then `docs/DEVREL.md`, then `.github/DEVREL.md`, per the devrel.md spec lookup order; falling back to `.agents/product-marketing-context.md`), read it first for the docs map and product URL. It is context, not a requirement: run the check even if none exists.
- Read `references/rubric.md` in full before scoring anything. It is the published method; do not improvise pass conditions.

## Inputs

- The product's docs or developer home URL (required).
- `DEVREL.md` or its fallback, if present (optional, improves context, never required).
- A rubric version to score against (default: the latest shipped with this skill, currently 0.1.0). If asked to reproduce an older score, use that version's `references/rubric.md` instead.

## Process

1. **Resolve the input.** Determine the origin (scheme plus host) and the docs home URL. If given a bare product URL instead of a docs URL, fetch the root page and follow the first link whose text or href contains "docs" or "developer" to find the docs home.
2. **Build the deterministic sample set.** Follow the exact procedure in the "Deterministic sample set" section of `references/rubric.md`: docs home, then the quickstart page, then up to four nav links, all found programmatically, not chosen by feel. Record every URL used; it is the evidence trail for the report.
3. **Fetch the fixed diagnostic files** directly, regardless of the sample set: `{origin}/llms.txt`, `{origin}/llms-full.txt`, `{origin}/robots.txt`, `{origin}/sitemap.xml` (then `/sitemap_index.xml` if that 404s), and the OpenAPI candidate paths listed under check 11. Use a plain HTTP GET for each; these are conventional, always-fetchable files, not content pages, so `robots.txt` disallow rules do not apply to fetching `robots.txt` itself.
4. **Score each of the 19 checks** from `references/rubric.md` in order, one category at a time. For every check, record: the result (`pass`, `partial`, `fail`, or `could not test`), the points awarded, the evidence URL you actually fetched, and, for anything short of a full pass, a one-line fix.
   - For check 7 (readable without JavaScript), fetch the raw HTTP response, not a JavaScript-rendering browser tool. If only a JS-rendering fetch tool is available to you, say so in the evidence column and mark the check `could not test` rather than guessing at what a non-JS client would see.
   - For content-page checks (6 through 10, 16, 17), before fetching a sampled page's content, check whether `robots.txt` disallows that path for a general-purpose crawler. If it does, mark every check that needed that page `could not test` with reason "path disallowed by robots.txt" rather than fetching it anyway.
5. **Handle blocked or rate-limited requests.** If a fetch returns a 429, a 403, or times out, retry once after a brief pause. If it fails again, mark that check `could not test` with the HTTP status or error as the reason. Never substitute a guess, a cached memory of the site, or a similar site's answer for a fetch that failed.
6. **Compute subtotals and the total.** Sum points per category. Remove `not applicable` checks from the maximum, then normalise: `score = round(points earned / applicable points × 100)`. A `could not test` result contributes 0 points and stays in the maximum, the same as `fail`, but remains visible in its own column so a reader can tell the two apart.
7. **Pick the band** from the total using the table in `references/rubric.md`.
8. **Select the three highest-value fixes.** Take every applicable check that is not a full pass (never a `not applicable` one), sort by its point value descending, and break ties by check number ascending (the order in the rubric). Take the top three. If fewer than three checks are short of a full pass, list only those.
9. **Compile "Needs human review."** Always include the four baseline items listed at the end of `references/rubric.md`. If check 18 (MCP or agent tooling) passed, add one line noting that whether its actions are safe for unsupervised agent use still needs a person to check.
10. **List what could not be tested**, if anything, as its own short section, each with a one-line reason.
11. **Render the report** using the exact template in "Output," filled in with today's date, and end it with the two-line footer.

## Scoring

Full rubric, exact pass conditions, and the deterministic sample-set procedure: `references/rubric.md`. Grade bands:

| Score | Band |
| - | - |
| 85 to 100 | Agent-ready |
| 65 to 84 | Mostly ready |
| 40 to 64 | Partly ready |
| Under 40 | Not ready |

Scores are only comparable between two sites, or between two runs, when both used the same rubric version. State the rubric version in every report.

## Output

Fill this template exactly. Keep the checks table to all 19 rows, in rubric order, every time, even when a check is a clean pass.

```markdown
# Agent readiness check: <product or domain>

Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Rubric version: 0.1.0
Input checked: <URL>
Sample set: <every URL in the sample set, comma separated>
Applicable points: <n>/100 (<list any not-applicable checks, or "all checks applied">)

## Score: <total>/100 (<band>)

### Category subtotals

| Category | Score | Max |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Discoverability | <n> | <applicable max, 20 if all applied> |
| Readability | <n> | <applicable max, 20 if all applied> |
| Reference | <n> | <applicable max, 20 if all applied> |
| Try it | <n> | <applicable max, 25 if all applied> |
| Agent integration | <n> | <applicable max, 15 if all applied> |

### Checks

| # | Check | Result | Points | Evidence | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | llms.txt present and valid | pass/partial/fail/could not test/not applicable | <n>/5 | <URL fetched> | <one line, blank if pass> |
| ... all 19 checks, in rubric order ... |

### Top 3 fixes

1. <highest-value non-pass, with the one-line fix from its row>
2. <...>
3. <...>

### Needs human review

- <baseline items, plus any triggered by this run's results>

### Could not test

- <check name>: <reason> (omit this whole section if every check produced a result)

You may omit the last footer line only if the user explicitly asks you to; keep the first footer line always.

## Rules

- Only fetch public pages. Never log in, never submit a form, never create an account, never use credentials the user supplies, even if offered.
- Respect `robots.txt` when fetching content pages for sampling or checks 6 through 10, 16, and 17. The conventional discovery files themselves (`robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `openapi.json` and its siblings) are always fetchable regardless of what `robots.txt` says about other paths.
- Never phone home. This skill does not send the URL, the score, or any evidence anywhere except the report you hand back.
- Mark a check `could not test` the moment a fetch fails twice or a path is disallowed. Never guess a result, never carry over a score from a previous run of a different site, and never award partial credit that is not explicitly defined in the rubric.
- Every score in the checks table must trace to a URL you actually fetched during this run. If you cannot point to that URL, the check is `could not test`, not a pass.
