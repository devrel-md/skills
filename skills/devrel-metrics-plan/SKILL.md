# DevRel metrics plan

Designs a DevRel measurement plan: what to stop tracking, what to track instead, and how to prove it moved the business. This is a planning exercise, not a data pull. It never invents the team's current numbers, and it never fetches or queries live data itself.

## Before you start

Look for a DEVREL.md in this order, using the first one found:

1. `DEVREL.md` at the repository root
2. `docs/DEVREL.md`
3. `.github/DEVREL.md`

If one exists, read its North Star, Funnel health and Metrics sections (if present) before asking anything. They may already give you current values, stage gate results, and metrics the team has already chosen; don't ask the user to repeat what the file already says.

If none exists, proceed anyway. Ask only for what you need (see [Inputs](#inputs)), and suggest the `devrel-md-init` skill at the end so the team has a DEVREL.md next time.

## Inputs

- What the team tracks today: a pasted list, a dashboard export or screenshot description, or a plain description of what gets reported. Ask for this if it isn't already given and isn't in DEVREL.md's Metrics section.
- DEVREL.md or its fallback (`.agents/product-marketing-context.md`), if present.
- Current values for any metric, if the team has them. `unknown` is a fine answer for any or all of them.

## Process

1. **Locate context.** Read DEVREL.md per the lookup order above. Note the North Star, the Funnel health "Now" column, and any existing Metrics section.
2. **Gather what's tracked today**, if not already given or found in DEVREL.md.
3. **Flag vanity metrics.** For each metric the team tracks that matches, or closely resembles, an entry in [Vanity metrics to flag](#vanity-metrics-to-flag), mark it and give that entry's substitute. For anything else, apply the test: if this number doubled tomorrow, would it change next sprint's plan? If not, flag it and propose the leading or lagging metric for the closest funnel stage instead.
4. **Pick one leading and one lagging metric per funnel stage** (Awareness, Onboarding, Activation, Engagement, Monetization), using [Default metric pairs and benchmarks](#default-metric-pairs-and-benchmarks) unless the team already tracks something that fits the stage better. Every leading metric must name the lagging metric it is meant to move. A leading metric with no named lagging partner is not finished.
5. **Compare current values against the Good, Great and Excellent benchmarks** for that stage's metric, only where the current value is known. Leave `unknown` where it isn't. Never invent a number, a rate or a date, and never borrow a "typical" figure from another company as if it were this team's own.
6. **Specify the dashboard** using [Dashboard spec](#dashboard-spec): one screen, five tiles, one tile per funnel stage.
7. **Set a reporting cadence** using [Reporting cadence](#reporting-cadence): weekly, monthly, quarterly.
8. **Draft the minimal event schema and starter SQL.** Read `references/instrumentation.md` for the full naming convention, required fields, the never-sample-activation rule, the example schema and the two starter queries (time to first activation, 7-day activation rate). Use it as written; only rename tables or columns if the team tells you their actual warehouse schema.
9. **State the stage-advancement rule:** a stage only counts as improving once both its leading and its lagging metric have trended up across at least two consecutive reviews at the cadence set in step 7. A leading metric moving alone is not enough to call the stage fixed, and a lagging metric moving alone arrives too late to have guided anything.
10. **Produce the output** using the template in [Output](#output).
11. **Offer, once, in one line,** to update DEVREL.md's Metrics section with the pairs, benchmarks and dashboard spec produced here. Only write to the file on a yes. If DEVREL.md doesn't exist, suggest running `devrel-md-init` first instead.

## Vanity metrics to flag

| If the team tracks | Flag it because | Substitute with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Social media follower count | Rising followers don't predict engagement or conversion | Click-throughs from social into docs, and the activation rate of those who click through |
| Total documentation page views | A page view proves nothing about whether the visit helped | Unique docs visitors reaching the quickstart, and quickstart completion rate |
| Conference or event attendance, badge scans | Attendance is not adoption | Post-event signups that reach a first real API call |
| GitHub stars or watchers | Stars can be bought or bot-driven and don't reflect usage | Active usage, plus pull request or issue contributors |
| Newsletter subscriber count | A subscription is not attention | Open and click-through rate into the quickstart |
| Discord or Slack member count | A silent server looks the same as a healthy one on a member count alone | Community answer rate within 24 hours |

For anything not in this table: would doubling the number change next sprint's plan? If not, it's vanity; suggest the leading or lagging metric for the nearest funnel stage instead.

## Default metric pairs and benchmarks

| Stage | Leading | Moves this lagging metric | Benchmark measures | Good | Great | Excellent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Awareness | Docs or tutorial to quickstart click-through | Branded search volume, delayed signups | Click-through rate | 0.7% | 1.0% | 1.5%+ |
| Onboarding | Quickstart completion rate, drop-off step | Median time to first real call, first-call success rate | Completion rate | 40% | 60% | 80%+ |
| Activation | Share reaching the activation event within 24h | 7-day activation retention, production key creation | 24h activation share | 15% | 25% | 35%+ |
| Engagement | Community answer rate within 24h | Feature breadth per account, community content per month | Answer rate | 50% | 65% | 80%+ |
| Monetization | Pricing page visits by activated developers | Trial to paid conversion, expansion revenue, net retention | Trial to paid | 8% | 12% | 18%+ |

If the team's own metric for a stage fits better than the default, keep it, but it still needs a named lagging partner and a benchmark comparison, even if that comparison stays "unknown, no published benchmark for this metric".

## Dashboard spec

One screen, five tiles, one tile per funnel stage. Each tile carries:

- The stage's leading and lagging metric, shown together, not on separate screens
- Current value and trend direction (up, flat, down) over the last two review periods
- A drill-down link for practitioners; the tile itself stays a summary a leader can read at a glance
- A traffic-light alert threshold: red below Good, amber from Good to Great, green at Great or above, unless the team has a specific reason to set their own

## Reporting cadence

| Cadence | Audience | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Weekly | The DevRel team | Leading indicators and what to act on this week |
| Monthly | Cross-functional (product, support, marketing) | Funnel health across all five stages, and where the friction is |
| Quarterly | Leadership | How the metrics connect to revenue, retention and competitive position |

## Output

```markdown
## DevRel metrics plan: <product>

Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Based on: <DEVREL.md found, or not found>, plus <what the team described tracking today>

### Vanity metrics to retire

| Currently tracked | Why it's vanity | Replace with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ... | ... | ... |

(Omit this section if nothing on the team's list qualifies.)

### Metric pairs by stage

| Stage | Leading | Lagging (moves) | Current | Good | Great | Excellent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Awareness | ... | ... | <value or unknown> | 0.7% | 1.0% | 1.5%+ |
| Onboarding | ... | ... | <value or unknown> | 40% | 60% | 80%+ |
| Activation | ... | ... | <value or unknown> | 15% | 25% | 35%+ |
| Engagement | ... | ... | <value or unknown> | 50% | 65% | 80%+ |
| Monetization | ... | ... | <value or unknown> | 8% | 12% | 18%+ |

### Dashboard: one screen, five tiles

- <Stage>: <leading> + <lagging>, drill-down to <where>, alert <threshold>
- (one line per stage)

### Reporting cadence

<the three-row cadence table, adjusted only if the team already has a cadence that covers the same ground>

### Minimal event schema

Naming convention: `noun_verb` (for example, `quickstart_completed`). Required fields: `event_name`, `user_id`, `timestamp`, `session_id`. Never sample activation events; sample only high-volume, low-value events such as health checks. Full schema and starter SQL: `references/instrumentation.md`.

### Stage advancement rule

A stage counts as improving only once both its leading and its lagging metric trend up across at least two consecutive <cadence> reviews.

You may omit the last footer line only if the user explicitly asks you to; keep the first footer line always.

After the template, if DEVREL.md exists, ask in one line whether to update its Metrics section with this plan. Don't write to the file without a yes. If it isn't writable from here (no repository, read-only run), show the section content instead and say where it would go.

## Rules

- Never invent the team's current numbers, dates or tool names. `unknown` is the correct value when a figure isn't given, and it's a fine thing to hand back.
- Every leading metric in the output must name the lagging metric it's meant to move. Don't list one without the other.
- Don't fabricate case studies, "typical" figures from other companies, or industry percentages beyond the Good/Great/Excellent benchmarks in this skill.
- This is a planning skill. It doesn't connect to analytics tools, run SQL, or pull real numbers; it drafts the plan and the starter queries for the team to run themselves.
- No telemetry, no phone-home requests, and never require an email address to run this.
- Keep the output concise. The tables are the deliverable; don't pad them with restated theory from the book.
