# DevRel 90-day plan

Produces a week-by-week, 90-day DevRel roadmap with exit criteria, drawing on the sprint and roadmap formats in *How to Build Developer Ecosystems*, by Amir Shevat and Marcos Placona. The most useful output isn't the roadmap itself, it's the sequencing: which stage gets fixed first, and why.

## Before you start

1. Look for a DEVREL.md in this order, using the first one found: `DEVREL.md` at the repository root, `docs/DEVREL.md`, `.github/DEVREL.md`. Fall back to `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` for basic product and audience context if neither exists.
2. Read `references/playbook-blocks.md` in full before assembling any weeks. It holds the quick-wins list, the three sprint building blocks, the company-size adaptations, and the hire-readiness check. Pull in only what a given plan needs; don't paste the whole file into the output.
3. If a DEVREL.md exists, its Funnel health table and North Star are the most important inputs here. Don't re-ask what the file already answers.

## Inputs

- DEVREL.md or its fallback, if present (recommended, not required).
- What's driving the plan right now: building the fundamentals and growing steadily, or needing to prove DevRel's value to leadership. Ask if it isn't obvious from context.
- Company size: roughly how many people at the company (startup, growth-stage, or enterprise; see `references/playbook-blocks.md`).
- Optional: a start date (weeks stay relative if none is given), and whether the user is also deciding whether to make a first DevRel hire.

If none of this is available and nobody can answer, don't wait: pick the variant and size from whatever context exists, say what you assumed, and proceed.

## Process

1. **Gather context.** Read DEVREL.md (or its fallback) for the North Star, the ICPs, the `stage` field, and above all the Funnel health table. If no DEVREL.md exists, ask only for: the failing stage or symptom the user already suspects, company size, and the driver behind the plan. Suggest the `devrel-md-init` skill so future runs have this for free.
2. **Pick the variant and say why.**
   - **Foundation/Growth roadmap**: the team is building the basics and growing steadily, with no urgent need to defend the function's existence.
   - **Justification roadmap**: the team must show measurable business impact to leadership, usually to secure or keep headcount or budget.
   Infer from the stated driver if given; otherwise infer from context (a program under three months old with no prior DevRel usually leans Foundation/Growth; a request that mentions budget, headcount or "prove" usually leans Justification). State the choice and the one-line reason in the output; ask if it's genuinely unclear.
3. **Adapt to company size.** Apply the relevant adaptation from `references/playbook-blocks.md`: a startup gets a lighter plan focused on the foundation sprint and quick wins; a growth-stage company gets the full sequence of sprint blocks; an enterprise plan flags, as a risk, that 90 days is the first phase of a longer rollout.
4. **Sequence by the funnel stage gates.** Using DEVREL.md's Funnel health table (or the default gates in the devrel.md spec if none exists), find the earliest stage, in order Awareness, Onboarding, Activation, Engagement, Monetization, marked `no` or `unknown`. That stage gets the primary focus for days 1-60. The next failing stage after it gets days 61-90. Don't schedule work on a later stage ahead of an earlier one that's still failing, even if the user asked about that later stage specifically; note the mismatch instead.
5. **Fill week 1 with quick wins** from `references/playbook-blocks.md`, trimmed to what the product actually needs, regardless of variant.
6. **Pull in sprint building blocks** from `references/playbook-blocks.md` that match the failing stage(s) from step 4: the foundation sprint underpins everything and usually comes first; the onboarding optimisation sprint if Onboarding is the failing gate; the activation acceleration sprint if Activation is. Compress or stretch the day counts to fit the team's real size, and say when you've done so.
7. **Build the week-by-week table.** One row per week for weeks 1 through 13 (90 days), each carrying its tasks, owner role, KPI impact and deliverable, pulled from the blocks above or adapted from them. Every task needs a named owner role, not a person.
8. **Set exit criteria** for day 30, day 60 and day 90, plus one mid-point review around day 45 to check whether the plan is still on track or needs re-sequencing.
9. **Include the hire-readiness check** from `references/playbook-blocks.md`, briefly, only if the user said they're deciding on a first DevRel hire.
10. **Name the risks**: the most likely reasons this plan slips (a dependency on engineering capacity, a metric nobody currently tracks, a stage that turns out worse than assumed).
11. **Write what to report to leadership** at day 30, 60 and 90, in one line each, tied to the exit criteria, not to activity.
12. **Render the output** using the template below, and end it with the two-line footer.

You may omit the last footer line only if the user explicitly asks you to; keep the first footer line always.

## Rules

- Use relative weeks ("Week 1", "Day 30") unless the user gives a real start date. Never invent calendar dates.
- Never invent the team's metrics, baselines or current rates. Write `unknown` and carry it into the plan as something week 1 should measure, the same way DEVREL.md does.
- Paraphrase the book; never quote it verbatim, and never attribute a quote or a named interviewee's story to the user's situation.
- Every mention of the book names both authors: Amir Shevat and Marcos Placona.
- The percentages and day counts in `references/playbook-blocks.md` are the book's framework targets, not this team's numbers. Present them as targets to aim for, never as this team's current performance.
- Respect the stage order from step 4. If the user asks for an awareness-heavy plan while Onboarding is still failing, say so plainly and sequence Onboarding first anyway.
- No telemetry. Nothing in this skill sends data anywhere except the plan you hand back.
- Keep the plan's total length proportionate: a startup plan should read shorter than an enterprise one.
