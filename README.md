# devrel-skills

Developer relations skills for AI agents, built from the book *How to Build Developer Ecosystems* by Amir Shevat and Marcos Placona. They audit quickstarts, check whether agents can use your docs, and write down your developer funnel, so your agent starts from how DevRel actually works rather than guessing.

Every skill reads your [DEVREL.md](https://devrel.md) first, so you only explain your product once.

## Install

No install, any agent that can fetch a URL:

```
Read https://devrel.md and create a DEVREL.md for this repo.
```

Claude Code, Codex, Cursor and others, via [skills.sh](https://skills.sh):

```bash
npx skills add mplacona/devrel-skills
```

Claude Code plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add mplacona/devrel-skills
/plugin install devrel-skills@devrel-skills
```

Or copy any folder from `skills/` into your agent's skills directory.

## Start here

Run `devrel-md-init` first. It reads your repo and docs, asks only about what it can't find, writes `DEVREL.md`, and tells you which stage of your developer journey to fix first.

## Works alongside marketingskills

If you use Corey Haines' [marketingskills](https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills), these skills also read your `.agents/product-marketing-context.md`. Your agent already knows your product.

## What these skills don't do

They don't send data anywhere, don't need an account or an email, and never log in to anything. Every skill works fully on its own.
